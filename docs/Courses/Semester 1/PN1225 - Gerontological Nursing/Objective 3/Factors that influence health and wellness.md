# Factors that influence health and wellness

## Health and Wellness

**Health** is defined as the ability of the individual to do what is important to them.

Although it used to be seen through the lens of an absence of disease, nowadays it includes a person's strengths, resilience, capabilities and resources.

**Wellness** is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of illness or infirmity.

It is striving for the optimal level of health independent of the situation (disease, disability, illness).

### Components of Wellness

#### Psychological

Feeling in control of one's own health and being able to take responsibility for it.
Involves healthy coping and decision-making.


#### Spiritual

Spirituality and religious practices are linked to positive health outcomes with respect to life expectancy, cardiovascular conditions, chronic conditions, mental health and disabilities.

Provides a sense of meaning and a closer connection with others.

Transcends the physical and psychosocial aspects of a person.


#### Biological

Age-related physical changes, lifestyle factors and genetics all influence wellness.


#### Social

Satisfying norms and relationships; social support has a positive effect on health and wellness.

#### Environmental

**Physical** environment includes structural living arrangements.

**Social** environment includes healthy relationships, effective role transitions.


#### Cultural

## Theories of Aging

### Sociological theories

#### Disengagement

States that as a person ages the more likely they are disengage from others.
The more an older person stays present and engaged, the better their mental health.


#### Activity

States that staying active is the key to successful aging.
Physical activity and staying socially engaged leads to better health outcomes.


#### Continuity

States that successful aging is associated with one's ability to maintain consistent behaviours and roles, adapt, and find suitable replacements as the years go by.


### Psychological theories

#### Developmental

**Erikson's Psychosocial Theory of Development** 

|Approximate Age                | Psychosocial crisis         | Virtue     |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|
| Infancy (Under 1 year)         | Trust vs. Mistrust          | Hope       |
| Toddlerhood (1-2 years)        | Autonomy vs. Doubt          | Will       |
| Early childhood (3-6 years)    | Initiative vs. Guilt        | Purpose    |
| Middle childhood (7-10 years)  | Industry vs. Inferiority    | Competence |
| Adolescence (11-19 years)      | Identity vs. Role Confusion | Fidelity   |
| Early adulthood (20-44 years)  | Intimacy vs. Isolation      | Love       |
| Middle adulthood (45-64 years) | Generativity vs. Stagnation | Care       |
| Late adulthood (65 and above)  | Ego Integrity vs. Despair   | Wisdom     |

In late adulthood, older adults undergo the psychoocial crisis entitled "ego integrity vs. despair" where they will struggle with whether they are happy with the life they lived or if they live with regrets.


#### Gerotranscendence

A gradual shift from an older person caring less about the value of material things and instead focusing on the metaphysical or cosmic world.
