# Aging trends and societal views on aging

---

## What is Gerontology?

Before we begin to explore aging and what it means we first need to define what exactly Gerontology is and why does it have its own focus?

> **Gerontology** (or **Gerontological Nursing**) is a holistic approach to caring for older adults that encompasses all dimensions of a person.

In the past, the term **geriatric nursing** was used but was more illness / problem-focused. 

Many factors other than illness and disease affect the older populace, and measures must be taken to not only treat and heal but to prevent and protect.


## What is aging and when does it happen?

As soon as we open our eyes and breathe our first breath - the aging process begins.

Of course, the meaning of aging and its significance varies across different cultures, societies, and genders. In fact, aging used to be described as a disease!

Also, for example, Eastern cultures treat older adults extremely well because they are valued for their wisdom and knowledge.

Typically, age can be defined as:

### Chronological age

Age measured in years.

>"He is 28 years old!"


### Developmental age

Age is in accordance with how mature somebody is deemed to be.
Does the stage at which they are developmentally match with typical outcomes of those of the same chronological age?


## Categories of aging

There are four (4) categories of aging for older adults:

### Young-Old

Adults aged 65-74 years.

### Middle-Old

Adults aged 75-84 years.

### Old-old

Adults aged 85-99 years.

#### Centenarians

Adults aged 100+ years.
Technically a part of the old-old group.


## Contributors to successful aging

1. Diet
2. Maintaining proper weight
3. Exercise
4. Avoiding smoking
5. Social connection / handling stress


## Societal factors that influence aging

### Aging in Canada

#### Gender

Statistically, women live longer than men and live alone in widowhood.

#### Diversity

The older population is known to be very ethnically diverse.
By 2031, approximately 1 in 4 Canadians will be an immigrant.

This is why it is important to understand different cultures and the boundaries and challenges that come with that.

#### Economics

As people age there are more people leaving the workforce and paying taxes. 

#### Health Services

More specifically, access to health services is crucial to aging well and living a longer, healthier life.


### Global aging

Western Europe and Japan have more older people than young people.

Africa also has a relatively young population due to several factors.



## Reasons for aging trends in Canada

Simply put, people are living longer nowadays.

The life expectancy of a man in Canada is approximately 78 years old and a woman is 83.

Not only are people living longer, but the fertility rate has decreased. The average fertility rate per woman in Canada is 1.6 children.

Also, Baby Boomers are aging.

In fact, in 2045 it is projected that for the first time globally, there will be more people over 60 than under 15 years!


## Myths of Aging

- Depression is a normal part of aging
- Getting older inevitably leads to weakness, frailty and dependency
- Older adults should limit physical activity
- Old age means the end of sex
- All older adults lose their teeth


## Ageism

**Ageism** is when others stereotype or discriminate against people because they are 'old'.

It often stems from a limited understanding of the older population and rooted in myths about aging (as stated above).

Discriminating against older people is usually associated with negative attitude towards older adults but is not always mean-spirited and is sometimes unintentional.

Some examples include:
- Assuming older people are not capable of speaking for themselves
- Assuming older people will 'lose their minds' or their memory
- Believing that older people are 'too old' or not able to handle 'aggressive' treatments of disease like cancer or undergoing dialysis
- Family refrains from allowing experimental treatment because its 'too late anyways'
