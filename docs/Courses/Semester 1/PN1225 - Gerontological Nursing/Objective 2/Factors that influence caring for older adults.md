# Factors that influence caring for older adults

Before we explore the many factors that influence caring for older people, we must first learn about the evolution of gerontological nursing and how we arrived here in the first place.

## Evolution of Gerontological Nursing

In the early 1900's, caring for seniors was custodial in nature and focused moreso on physical aspects and not multiple dimensions of the individual.

Taking care and treating physical conditions was the number one priority.

Those who could afford to do so, however, would care for older adults at home and hire nurses to service them.

### Vera McIver and the Priory Method

Vera McIver, a nurse, believed that the state of nursing care at the time was encouraging dependence, restricted movement, and contributed to the death of the human spirit. By focusing on physical ailments and what the patient *couldn't* do, the patient would sooner experience a lack of dignity and wholeness.

In response, she invented a restorative model of care known as the **Priory Method**.


#### The Priory Method

This model of care focuses on providing the patient with independence and includes them as an active participant in their care.

For example, a person who has limited movement due to a stroke is usually provided with 'complete' care because half of their body is paralyzed and in recovery. However, the nurse can involve the patient by encouraging the person to feed themselves with their working hand, wash their own face, etc. This helps maintain a patient's independence and helps them to feel better because they are able to care for themselves and do things in some capacity.
