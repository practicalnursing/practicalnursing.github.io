# Factors that influence caring for older adults

Before we explore the many factors that influence caring for older people, we must first learn about the evolution of gerontological nursing and how we arrived here in the first place.

## Evolution of Gerontological Nursing

In the early 1900's, caring for seniors was custodial in nature and focused moreso on physical aspects and not multiple dimensions of the individual.

Taking care and treating physical conditions was the number one priority.

Those who could afford to do so, however, would care for older adults at home and hire nurses to service them.

### Vera McIver and the Priory Method

Vera McIver, a nurse, believed that the state of nursing care at the time was encouraging dependence, restricted movement, and contributed to the death of the human spirit. By focusing on physical ailments and what the patient *couldn't* do, the patient would sooner experience a lack of dignity and wholeness.

In response, she invented a restorative model of care known as the **Priory Method**.


#### The Priory Method

This model of care focuses on providing the patient with independence and includes them as an active participant in their care.

For example, a person who has limited movement due to a stroke is usually provided with 'complete' care because half of their body is paralyzed and in recovery. However, the nurse can involve the patient by encouraging the person to feed themselves with their working hand, wash their own face, etc. This helps maintain a patient's independence and helps them to feel better because they are able to care for themselves and do things in some capacity.


### Canadian Association of Gerontology

Founded on October 15, 1971 as a registered Canadian charity, the Canadian Association of Gerontology (CAG) is a national, multidisciplinary scientific and educational establishment.

They established six (6) competencies and standards of practice.

#### Six Competencies

1. Physiological health
2. Optimizing functional health
3. Responsive care
4. Relationship care
5. Health system
6. Safety and security


## Development of Gerontological Nursing

#### Nursing Roles

Where is gerontological care needed? It is required in a variety of settings, of which include:
- Hospitals
- Homes
- Acute and long-term care facilities
- Communities
- Rehabilitation care centers

The mission and primary role of nurses in gerontological care is to preserve function, enhance health, quality of life and end of life care.

#### Caring: Holistic Focus

There are several dimensions in relation to caring for older adults and promoting optimal health.

Holistic approaches are preferred and work by addressing the biopsychosocial and spiritual needs of the older adult.

##### Biopsychosocial and spiritual needs

This caring focus is an integral part of the conceptual framework and philosophy of the practical nursing program.

**Bio** refers to the dimension of physical health.

This part relates to how well an older adult is able to function physically in the face of illness or delibitating disease. This varies from person to person.

**Psycho** refers to psychological health.

How well can the older adult cope with stress and mentally taxing stimuli? The loss of mental faculties and coping capabilities is experienced at different levels and in many different ways.

**Social** refers to social health.

Human beings are social animals, and the state of our social lives and how we interact with those around us is immensely important to both physical and mental health.

**Spiritual** refers to spiritual health.

Although many people think of religion when exploring the spiritual dimension of a human being, it is important to note that this part of us goes much deeper and can be represented and appear in several different ways.

### Setting

Care is provided to older adults in many different locations.

Most commonly, care is provided in institutions such as long-term care, acute care, and community care settings.

The care is directly provided by RNs, LPNs, PCAs and also overseen/monitored by physicians, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists.

#### Long-term care (LTC)

This setting is not easy to define because the boundaries between primary, acute and long-term care have blurred. 

The main goal of long-term care facilities is to concentrate on assisting individuals with functioning as well as they possibly can.

They are often known as "nursing homes" and most residents are older adults with complex needs. The services are designed to minimize, rehabilitate, or compensate for loss of independent physical or mental functioning.

Services provided include:
- Bathing
- Dressing
- Feeding
- Other personal care
- Meal preparation
- Cleaning
- Shopping
- Money management
- Medication management
- Transportation

Over 50% (half) of residents are 85 years or older and 2/3 have cognitive impairment.
Here you will find the frailest of the older adult population that requires 24-hour care.

Most residents have chronic illnesses and require very high levels of care.

##### Roles of LPNs

The roles of LPNs working in long-term care include:

Leadership - The LPN is often responsible for a number of residents, constructing and implementing a plan that will lead to optimal health.

Decision-making  - The LPN must be able to think on their feet and manage difficult situations.   Will have to know the appropriate response in certain situations and when to call the RN who is overseeing multiple units.

Knowledgeable - The LPN is always learning and must be up to date with the best practice guidelines in order to provide optimal care and provide guidance and support PCAs.

Effective communication and collaboration - The LPN should know and be familiar with the RN as the first line to discuss care needs of residents.

Delegation of tasks to PCAs - The LPNs oversee the work of PCAs, who provide basic are to residents.

##### Roles of RNs

The responsibilities of RNs are rooted in higher level decision-making.

This involves overseeing LPNs, implementing and collaborating with the interdisciplinary team and family regarding a plan for the level of care for each resident.

These include:
- Comfort care measures
- Palliative care
- Ethical and legal implications of actions
- Mental capacity
- Enduring power of attorney
- Managing skill mix and assigning staff and tasks appropriately according to individual needs

##### Rights of clients in LTC

The rights of clients should be at the forefront and reflected in the mission, vision, and values of the health care provider and setting.

Everybody involved in the caring process should be aware of institutional policies regarding these rights.


#### Acute care

This setting is active but supposed to be temporary where older adults are cared for up until they are able to be discharged and return to normal life.

Older adults comprise a large number of patients in acute care settings.

The role of nurses in this setting is to become knowledgeable about the needs of older adults and being able to understand and handle the complexity of managing multiple conditions and needs.

The prevention of further complications is usually the primary focus for nurses providing acute care.


#### Community-based

Approximately 93% of older adults live in community settings. 

These include home care, independent living complexes, retirement communities, and adult day care programs. 

Seniors have the desire to age and live in their own homes.

Health promotion is important here to promote optimal function and safety for the individual and family.

This is especially important for older adults with chronic illnesses who want to maintain their independence and live in familiar surroundings.


### The future of gerontological care

As of right now, demand is critical for gerontological nurses and other health professionals to care for older people. People are getting increasingly older and more staff is needed to meet this demand. 

The shortage of nurses is an issue that will hopefully be resolved as time moves on.

The Baby Boomers are a significant portion of the population that is getting older. Well versed regarding their health challenges, treatments and ways of staying healthy. It will be helpful to be familiar with the mindset of this group of older adults.

Also, global policites must be developed to meet income, health, and long-term care needs for men and women throughout the world.
