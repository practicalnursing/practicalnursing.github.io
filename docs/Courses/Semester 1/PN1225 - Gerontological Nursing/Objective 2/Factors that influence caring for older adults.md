# Factors that influence caring for older adults

Before we explore the many factors that influence caring for older people, we must first learn about the evolution of gerontological nursing and how we arrived here in the first place.

## Evolution of Gerontological Nursing

In the early 1900's, caring for seniors was custodial in nature and focused moreso on physical aspects and not multiple dimensions of the individual.

Taking care and treating physical conditions was the number one priority.

Those who could afford to do so, however, would care for older adults at home and hire nurses to service them.

### Vera McIver and the Priory Method

Vera McIver, a nurse, believed that the state of nursing care at the time was encouraging dependence, restricted movement, and contributed to the death of the human spirit. By focusing on physical ailments and what the patient *couldn't* do, the patient would sooner experience a lack of dignity and wholeness.

In response, she invented a restorative model of care known as the **Priory Method**.


#### The Priory Method

This model of care focuses on providing the patient with independence and includes them as an active participant in their care.

For example, a person who has limited movement due to a stroke is usually provided with 'complete' care because half of their body is paralyzed and in recovery. However, the nurse can involve the patient by encouraging the person to feed themselves with their working hand, wash their own face, etc. This helps maintain a patient's independence and helps them to feel better because they are able to care for themselves and do things in some capacity.


### Canadian Association of Gerontology

Founded on October 15, 1971 as a registered Canadian charity, the Canadian Association of Gerontology (CAG) is a national, multidisciplinary scientific and educational establishment.

They established six (6) competencies and standards of practice.

#### Six Competencies

1. Physiological health
2. Optimizing functional health
3. Responsive care
4. Relationship care
5. Health system
6. Safety and security


## Development of Gerontological Nursing

#### Nursing Roles

Where is gerontological care needed? It is required in a variety of settings, of which include:
- Hospitals
- Homes
- Acute and long-term care facilities
- Communities
- Rehabilitation care centers

The mission and primary role of nurses in gerontological care is to preserve function, enhance health, quality of life and end of life care.

#### Caring: Holistic Focus

There are several dimensions in relation to caring for older adults and promoting optimal health.

Holistic approaches are preferred and work by addressing the biopsychosocial and spiritual needs of the older adult.

##### Biopsychosocial and spiritual needs

This caring focus is an integral part of the conceptual framework and philosophy of the practical nursing program.

**Bio** refers to the dimension of physical health.

This part relates to how well an older adult is able to function physically in the face of illness or delibitating disease. This varies from person to person.

**Psycho** refers to psychological health.

How well can the older adult cope with stress and mentally taxing stimuli? The loss of mental faculties and coping capabilities is experienced at different levels and in many different ways.

**Social** refers to social health.

Human beings are social animals, and the state of our social lives and how we interact with those around us is immensely important to both physical and mental health.

**Spiritual** refers to spiritual health.

Although many people think of religion when exploring the spiritual dimension of a human being, it is important to note that this part of us goes much deeper and can be represented and appear in several different ways.
