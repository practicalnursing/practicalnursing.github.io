# Skeletal System

## Quick Facts

- The skeletal system is made up of [bones](Bone), [cartilage](Cartilage), [ligaments](Ligament) and [tendons](Tendon).

- It contains approximately 206 bones.

- It forms the framework of the body, which is rigid and strong but lightweight.

- Bones have surface markings as well as unique characteristics such as holes, depressions, projections and lines.

- Consists of active [tissue](Tissue) that is involved in the body's function.

## Three types of skeletal cartilage

![[3 Types of Cartilage.jpeg]]


### Hyaline

A bluish-white translucent type of cartilage mostly present in the joints and respiratory tract.

- Provide support, flexibility, and resistance

- They are the most abundant type of cartilage found throughout the body

- Made of thick, collagen fibers


#### Types of Hyaline Cartilage


##### Articular

Covers the end of most bones at movable joints.


##### Costal

Responsible for connecting the ribs to the sternum.


##### Respiratory

Forms the skeleton of the larynx and reinforces the passageways of the respiratory system.


##### Nasal

Supports the external nose.



### Elastic

Quite similar to hyaline cartilage but is made of elastic fibers and can bend more easily.

It is found in the [epiglottis](Epiglottis) and the external ear.


### Fibrocartilage

A type of cartilage that has great tensile strength and is highly compressible.

It is found in areas that will be subjected to pressure and can stretch.

Found mostly in the vertebral discs and the knee (caps).


## Growth of cartilage

### Appositional growth

The increase in diameter of the bone by the addition of bony tissue at the surface.

This happens during late adolescence and throughout adulthood.


### Interstitial growth
