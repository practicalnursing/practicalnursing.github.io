# Skeletal System

## Quick Facts

- The skeletal system is made up of [bones](Bone.md), [cartilage](Cartilage.md), [ligaments](Ligament.md) and [tendons](Tendon.md).

- It contains approximately 206 bones.

- It forms the framework of the body, which is rigid and strong but lightweight.

- Bones have surface markings as well as unique characteristics such as holes, depressions, projections and lines.

- Consists of active [tissue](Tissue.md) that is involved in the body's function.

## Three types of skeletal cartilage
---

![[3 Types of Cartilage.jpeg]]


### Hyaline

A bluish-white translucent type of cartilage mostly present in the joints and respiratory tract.

- Provide support, flexibility, and resistance

- They are the most abundant type of cartilage found throughout the body

- Made of thick, collagen fibers


#### Types of Hyaline Cartilage


##### Articular

Covers the end of most bones at movable joints.


##### Costal

Responsible for connecting the ribs to the sternum.


##### Respiratory

Forms the skeleton of the larynx and reinforces the passageways of the respiratory system.


##### Nasal

Supports the external nose.



### Elastic

Quite similar to hyaline cartilage but is made of elastic fibers and can bend more easily.

It is found in the [epiglottis](Epiglottis) and the external ear.


### Fibrocartilage

A type of cartilage that has great tensile strength and is highly compressible.

It is found in areas that will be subjected to pressure and can stretch.

Found mostly in the vertebral discs and the knee (caps).


## Growth of cartilage

### Appositional growth

The increase in diameter of the bone by the addition of bony tissue at the surface.
This increases bone **thickness**.

This happens during late adolescence and throughout adulthood.


### Interstitial growth

The increase in length of the growing bone.

This works by chondrocutes dividing and secreting a new matrix, expanding the cartilage from within.

This happens during childhood and early adolescence.


### Classification of Bones

Bones are classified based on region, shape, and embryonic development.

#### Region

Divided into two (2) groups based on location.

![[Axial and Appendicular.png]]

##### Axial Skeleton

The skull, vertebral column, and rib cage.

This region is comprised of 74 bones including 6 ear bones.


##### Appendicular Skeleton

The upper and lower limbs.

This region is comprised of 126 bones.

#### Shape

There are four (4) distinct shapes of bones: long bones, short bones, flat bones, and irregular bones.

##### Long Bones
![[Long Bone.jpg]]

Has a long shaft with two bulky ends.

The long shaft is called a **diaphysis** and the bulky ends are **epiphysis**.

The name is derived from their elongated shape and not the actual size of the bone.

Three (3) bones in the finger are also classified as long bones even though they are small.

Found in the thigh, leg, arms and forearm.


##### Short Bones

![[Short Bone.jpg]]

Cube-shaped bones that vary in size and number in different individuals.

Found in the wrist and ankle.

**Sesamoid bones** are a special type of short bone that forms in a tendon (patella).


##### Flat Bones

![[Flat Bone.jpg]]

These bones are thin, flat and often curved.

Found in the skull, sternum, scapula and ribs.


##### Irregular Bones

![[Irregular Bone.jpg]]

These bones are any bones that do not fall into the other categories.

They often have complicated, peculiar shapes.

Examples include the vertebrae, hip bones, some skull bones, and facial bones.

#### Embryonic Development

There are two categories: **intramembraneous** and **endochondral** ossification.

##### Intramembraneous Ossification

The process of bone development from fibrous membranes. 
It replaces the connective tissue membranes with bony tissue and occurs during fetal development.

Examples include the flat bones of the skull, mandible
