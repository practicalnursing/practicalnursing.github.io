## Levels of organization in the body

![[Levels of Organization.png]]

---

### Chemical

Refers to atoms, molecules, macromolecules, and organelles.

---

##### Atoms

The basic unit of a chemical element.

---

##### Molecule

A group of atoms bonded together.

---

##### Macromolecule

A molecule containing a very large number of atoms.

Example: Proteins & nucleic acid

---

##### Organelle

Specialized structures that perform various jobs inside cells.

Example: [[Golgi Apparatus]], Rough [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]]

---

### Cellular

Refers to [cells](Cell.md), the basic structural and functional unit of life.

---

### Tissue

A group of structurally and functionally similar cells.

---

### Organ

A part of the body that performs a specific function.

Example: Heart, Liver, Lungs

---

### Organ System

A biological system consisting of a group of organs that work together to perform one or more functions.

Example: Integumentary, Nervous, Digestive, etc.

---

### Organism

A living thing made up of one or more cells that is able to carry on the activities of life.

## Body functions necessary for life

The eight (8) bodily functions necessary for life are:

---

### Maintaining boundaries

The internal environment must be separate or distinct from the external environment.

This is an important concept when we discuss [[Homeostasis]]

---

### Metabolism

[[Metabolism]] is defined as chemical reactions in the body.

[[Catabolism]] is when complex substances are broken into simpler parts and energy is released.

[[Anabolism]] is when simple parts use energy to construct complex substances.

---

### Responsiveness

Also known as *excitability*.

Responding and reacting to changes in the internal and external environment.

The [[Nervous System]] is mostly involved in responsiveness.

---

### Movement

Occurs in body through muscles due to [[Contractility]].

Many types/examples throughout the body:
<ul>
  <li>Blood</li>
  <li>Cells</li>
  <li>Breathing muscles</li>
  <li>Skeletal muscles</li>
  <li>Food</li>
</ul>

---

### Reproduction

There are two types:

- Formation of new person (organism)

- Formation of new [cells](Cell) (cellular)


Both types are essential for life and the continuation of a species.

---

### Growth

Increase in the size of a body part or entire organism.

[Anabolic](Anabolism.md) (constructive) processes must occur faster than [Catabolic](Catabolism.md) (destructive) processes.

---

### Digestion

The [metabolic](Metabolism.md) process of breaking down food into simpler [molecules](Molecule.md) to be used by the body

---

### Excretion

The removal of waste products and toxic substances from the body that theaten life.

Also the removal of byproducts, substances that the body is unable to utilize for useful purposes.

---

## Eleven body systems and their functions

The following are [organ systems](Organ System), a collection of [organs](Organ) that work together to make the body work.

### [[Integumentary System]]

Covers and protects the body; also regulates temperature.

### [[Skeletal System]]

Provides body framework and support; attaches muscles to bones; provides calcium storage.

### [[Muscular System]]

Produces movement, maintains posture and provides heat.

### [[Nervous System]]

Coordinates body activities; receives and transmits stimuli.

### [[Endocrine System]]

Regulates metabolic activities and body chemistry.

### [[Cardiovascular System]]

Transports materials from one part of the body to another; defends against disease.

### [[Lymphatic (Immune) System]]

Returns tissue fluid to the blood; defends against disease.

### [[Digestive System]]

Ingests and digests food; absorbs nutrients into the blood.

### [[Respiratory System]]

Exchanges gases between the blood and the external environment.

### [[Urinary System]]

Involved in excretion of metabolic waste; regulates fluid balance and acid-base (pH) balance.

### [[Reproductive System]]

Forms new individuals contributing to the continuation of the species.

## Homeostasis and its function in maintaining life

[[Homeostasis]] refers to a constant internal environment even though the external world is constantly changing.

All organ systems of the body, under direction from the [nervous](Nervous System) and [endocrine](Endocrine System) system, work together to maintain homeostasis.


### Homeostatic Control

Homeostasis is also referred to as the set point (desired value of a variable).

There are three (3) main components of homeostasis:

##### Receptor

Receives information from a stimulus regarding the status of the body and relays it to the control center along the afferent pathway.

##### Control Center

Processes information received from the receptor and sends signals to the effector along the efferent pathway.

##### Effector

A cell, tissue, or organ that receives information from the control center and sends a signal to the appropriate place to stimulate action and return the body to equilibrium.


### Feedback Loop Mechanisms

|          | Negative Feedback                               | Positive Feedback                               |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Example  | Regulation of body temperature or blood glucose | Normal childbirth                               |
| Response | Reverses a change in physiological condition    | Intensifies a change in physiological condition |
| Result   | Return to a set point                           | Reach an end point                              |
| Overall  | Provide stability                               | Accelerates a process to completion             |


##### Negative Feedback

A product of a reaction leads to a decrease in the frequency of that reaction.

A good example of this is the regulation of body temperature because, of course, body temperature doesn't just swing above its target value—it can also drop below this value. In general, homeostatic circuits usually involve at least two negative feedback loops:

<ul>
<li>One is activated when a parameter—like body temperature—is _above_ the set point and is designed to bring it back down.</li>
<br>
<li>One is activated when the parameter is _below_ the set point and is designed to bring it back up.</li>
</ul>

##### Positive Feedback

A product of a reaction leads to an increase of in the frequency of that reaction.

A positive feedback loop comes into play during childbirth. In childbirth, the baby's head presses on the cervix—the bottom of the uterus, through which the baby must emerge—and activates neurons to the brain. The neurons send a signal that leads to release of the hormone oxytocin from the pituitary gland.

Oxytocin increases uterine contractions, and thus pressure on the cervix. This causes the release of even more oxytocin and produces even stronger contractions. This positive feedback loop continues until the baby is born.

## Directional terms of the body

The directional terms used to describe the body are:

---

### Superior

Means above or in a higher position (closer to the head).

Example: *The eyes are superior to the neck.*

---

### Inferior

Means below or in a lower position (closer to the feet).

Example: The chest is inferior to the neck.

---

### Ventral/Anterior

Means located towards the front of the body; toward the belly surface.

Example: The abdomen is ventral to the back.

---

### Dorsal/Posterior

Means located towards the back of the body.

Example: The spine is dorsal to the breastbone.

---

### Medial

Means nearer to the middle of the body.

Example: The nose is medial to the ears.

---

### Lateral

Means nearer to the side of the body.

Example: The ears are lateral to the eyes.

---

### Proximal

Means nearer to the point of origin of the structure.

Example: The elbow is proximal to the wrist.

---

### Distal

Means farther from the point of origin of the structure.

Example: The fingers are distal to the wrist.

---

### Superficial

Means near or on surface of the body.

Example: The superficial (outermost layer) of the skin is the epidermis.

---

### Deep

Means farther away from the surface of the body.

Example: Muscles are deep to the skin.

## Three planes of division of the body

![[Anatomical Planes.jpg]]

### Sagittal Plane

The body is split into left and right sections

### Transverse Plane

The body is split into superior (upper) and inferior (lower) sections.

### Frontal Plane

The body is split into anterior/ventral (front) and posterior/dorsal sections.


---

## Two major body cavities and their subdivisions

The body is divided into two main cavities: the **_ventral/anterior_** and **_dorsal/posterior cavity_**.

---

### Ventral/Anterior Cavity

The ventral/anterior cavity is in the **anterior (front)** of the body. It consists of two components: the **thoracic cavity** and the **abdominopelvic cavity**. The abdominopelvic cavity is made up of the abdominal cavity and the pelvic cavity.

The thoracic cavity contains the main organs of the respiratory and cardiovascular system (**lungs, heart**) as well as parts of other systems such as the esophagus, and the thymus gland.

The abdominopelvic cavity contains the main organs of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems, as well as parts of the endocrine system (**adrenal glands**)

---

### Dorsal/Posterior Cavity

The dorsal/posterior cavity is in the **posterior (back)** of the body. It consists of two components as well: the **spinal cavity** and the **cranial cavity**.

The spinal cavity (also known as the vertebral cavity) contains the spinal cord, meninges (protective layer) and cerebrospinal fluid (CBF).  

The cranial cavity contains the space within the skull. It contains the brain, meninges (protective layer) and CBF.

## Nine abdominal regions and the four abdominal quadrants

The abdominal area is usually divided in two ways: nine sections or four abdominal quadrants.

---

### The nine abdominal regions

![[Regions of Abdominal - 9.gif]]

The **epigastric region** is located just above the main organs of the digestive system (stomach, digestive tract, colon, etc.)
"Epi" is a prefix meaning "above or upon" and "gastric" means "of the stomach".

The **hypochondriac regions** are located on either side of the epigastric region and just below the pectorals.
"Hypo" means "under or below" and chondriac refers to the cartilage of the ribs.

The **umbilical region** is amptly named, referring to the navel area and the location of the umbilical cord.

The **lumbar regions** are located on either side of the umbilical region and directly below the hypochondriac regions respectively.

The **hypogastic region** is located directly below the umbilical region and the main organs of the digestive system.

The **iliac regions** are located on either side of the hypogastric region and contain the iliac bone (a main part of the hip bone).
