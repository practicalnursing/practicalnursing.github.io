The **epigastric region** is located just above the main organs of the digestive system (stomach, digestive tract, colon, etc.)
"Epi" is a prefix meaning "above or upon" and "gastric" means "of the stomach".

The **hypochondriac regions** are located on either side of the epigastric region and just below the pectorals.
"Hypo" means "under or below" and chondriac refers to the chest cartilage.

The **umbilical region** is amptly named, referring to the navel area and the location of the umbilical cord.

The **lumbar regions** are located on either side of the umbilical region and directly below the hypochondriac regions respectively.

The **hypogastic region** is located directly below the umbilical region and the main organs of the digestive system.

The **iliac regions** are located on either side of the hypogastric region and contain the iliac bone (a main part of the hip bone).
