# Body functions necessary for life

The eight (8) bodily functions necessary for life are:

### Maintaining boundaries

The internal environment must be separate or distinct from the external environment.

This is an important concept when we discuss [[Homeostasis]]

### Metabolism

[[Metabolism]] is defined as chemical reactions in the body.

[[Catabolism]] is when complex substances are broken into simpler parts and energy is released.

[[Anabolism]] is when simple parts use energy to construct complex substances.

### Responsiveness

Also known as *excitability*.

Responding and reacting to changes in the internal and external environment.

The [[Nervous System]] is mostly involved in responsiveness.

### Movement

Occurs in body through muscles due to [[Contractility]].

Many types/examples throughout the body:
- Blood
- Cells
- Breathing muscles
- Skeletal muscles
- Food


### Reproduction

There are two types:
1. Formation of new person (organism)
2. Formation of new [cells](Cells) (cellular)

Both types are essential for life and the continuation of a species.

### Growth

Increase in the size of a body part or entire organism.

[Anabolic]([[Anabolism]]) (constructive) processes must occur faster than [Catabolic]([[Catabolism]]) (destructive) processes.

### Digestion

The [metabolic]([[Metabolism]]) process of breaking down food into simpler [molecules](Molecule.md) to be used by the body


### Excretion

The removal of waste products and toxic substances from the body that theaten life.

Also the removal of byproducts, substances that the body is unable to utilize for useful purposes.
