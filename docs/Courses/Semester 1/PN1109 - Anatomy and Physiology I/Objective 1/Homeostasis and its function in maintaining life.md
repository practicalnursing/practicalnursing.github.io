# Homeostasis and its function in maintaining life

[[Homeostasis]] refers to a constant internal environment even though the external world is constantly changing.

All organ systems of the body, under direction from the [nervous](Nervous System) and [endocrine](Endocrine System) system, work together to maintain homeostasis.




### Homeostatic Control

There are three (3) main components of homeostasis:

##### Receptor

Receives information regarding the status of the body and relays it to the control center.

##### Control Center

Processes information received from the receptor and sends signals to the effector along an efferent pathway.

##### Effector

Receives information from the control center and sends a signal to the appropriate place to stimulate action and return the body to equilibrium.


### Feedback Loop Mechanisms

##### Positive Feedback



##### Negative Feedback
