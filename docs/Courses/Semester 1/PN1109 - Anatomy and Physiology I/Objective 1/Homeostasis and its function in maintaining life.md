# Homeostasis and its function in maintaining life

[[Homeostasis]] refers to a constant internal environment even though the external world is constantly changing.

All organ systems of the body, under direction from the [nervous](Nervous System) and [endocrine](Endocrine System) system, work together to maintain homeostasis.


### Homeostatic Control

Homeostasis is also referred to as the set point (desired value of a variable)

There are three (3) main components of homeostasis:

##### Receptor

Receives information regarding the status of the body and relays it to the control center along the afferent pathway.

##### Control Center

Processes information received from the receptor and sends signals to the effector along an efferent pathway.

##### Effector

Receives information from the control center and sends a signal to the appropriate place to stimulate action and return the body to equilibrium.


### Feedback Loop Mechanisms

|          | Negative Feedback                               | Positive Feedback                               |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Example  | Regulation of body temperature or blood glucose | Normal childbirth                               |
| Response | Reverses a change in physiological condition    | Intensifies a change in physiological condition |
| Result   | Return to a set point                           | Reach an end point                              |
| Overall  | Provide stability                               | Accelerates a process to completion             |


##### Negative Feedback

A product of a reaction leads to a decrease in the frequency of that reaction.

A good example of this is the regulation of body temperature because, of course, body temperature doesn't just swing above its target value—it can also drop below this value. In general, homeostatic circuits usually involve at least two negative feedback loops:

<ul>
<li>One is activated when a parameter—like body temperature—is _above_ the set point and is designed to bring it back down.</li>
<br>
<li>One is activated when the parameter is _below_ the set point and is designed to bring it back up.</li>
</ul>

##### Positive Feedback

A product of a reaction leads to an increase of in the frequency of that reaction.

A positive feedback loop comes into play during childbirth. In childbirth, the baby's head presses on the cervix—the bottom of the uterus, through which the baby must emerge—and activates neurons to the brain. The neurons send a signal that leads to release of the hormone oxytocin from the pituitary gland.

Oxytocin increases uterine contractions, and thus pressure on the cervix. This causes the release of even more oxytocin and produces even stronger contractions. This positive feedback loop continues until the baby is born.
