# Two major body cavities and their subdivisions

The body is divided into two main cavities: the **_ventral/anterior_** and **_dorsal/posterior cavity_**.

---

### Ventral/Anterior Cavity

The ventral/anterior cavity is in the **anterior (front)** of the body. It consists of two components: the **thoracic cavity** and the **abdominopelvic cavity**. The abdominopelvic cavity is made up of the abdominal cavity and the pelvic cavity.

The thoracic cavity contains the main organs of the respiratory and cardiovascular system (**lungs, heart**) as well as parts of other systems such as the esophagus, and the thymus gland.

The abdominopelvic cavity contains the main organs of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems, as well as parts of the endocrine system (**adrenal glands**)

### Dorsal/Posterior Cavity

The dorsal/posterior cavity is in the **posterior (back)** of the body. It consists of two components as well: the **spinal cavity** and the **cranial cavity**.

The spinal cavity (also known as the vertebral cavity) contains the spinal cord, meninges (protective layer) and cerebrospinal fluid (CBF).  
  
The cranial cavity contains the space within the skull. It contains the brain, meninges (protective layer) and CBF.
