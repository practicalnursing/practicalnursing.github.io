## History of Nursing in Canada

The history of nursing in Canada is generally accepted to have started around the 1640's when the very first hospital, **L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec** was built in New France.

The hospital was founded by a French nurse (and one of the founders of New France) named **Jeanne Mance**.

At the time, however, there was already an established Indigenous society of about 500,000 people. They embraced health care knowledge of their own, relying heavily on the use of herbal remedies to treat sickness and disease. 

Before Mance's arrival, their presence would serve as divine motivation for Madame Hébert, a lay nurse. She would provide care to settlers and to Indigenous people with hopes of "saving" them. This theme continued with the first nurses being male attendants and Jesuit priests.

Nearly a century later, Marguerite d'Youville formed the Sisters of Charity (also known as the Grey Nuns) becoming the first visiting nurses.

The Grey Nuns gained respect for the work they did, providing cares at homes during epidemics. After spending time in Montreal, they moved West and established missions in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Northwest Territories.

### Florence Nightengale

Florence Nightengale is known as the founder of modern nursing.

She first came to prominence as the appointed superintendent of English nurses in the Crimean War (1853-56). During the war, she was responsible for reducing the soldier mortality rate from 44% to 2.2% in 6 months.

She defined nursing as a profession for women, separate and distinct from medicine, using nature's laws of health in service of humanity.

Her goal was to ensure that the patient was in the best condition possible, in an environment conducive to healthy living and a nourishing diet.

She is responsible for establishing a clean environment and hand hygeine as essential basic practice.
