The hospital was founded by a French nurse (and one of the founders of New France) named Jeanne Mance . At the time, however, there was already an established Indigenous society of about 500,000 people. They embraced health care knowledge of their own, relying heavily on the use of herbal remedies to treat sickness and disease. Before Mance's arrival, their presence would serve as divine motivation for Madame H\u00e9bert, a lay nurse. She would provide care to settlers and to Indigenous people with hopes of \"saving\" them. This theme continued with the first nurses being male attendants and Jesuit priests. Nearly a century later, Marguerite d'Youville formed the Sisters of Charity (also known as the Grey Nuns) becoming the first visiting nurses.

Atoms \u00b6 The basic unit of a chemical element. Molecule \u00b6 A group of atoms bonded together. Macromolecule \u00b6 A molecule containing a very large number of atoms. Example: Proteins & nucleic acid Organelle \u00b6 Specialized structures that perform various jobs inside cells. Example: Golgi Apparatus , Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum Cellular \u00b6 Refers to cells , the basic structural and functional unit of life. Tissue \u00b6 A group of structurally and functionally similar cells. Organ \u00b6 A part of the body that performs a specific function. Example: Heart, Liver, Lungs Organ System \u00b6 A biological system consisting of a group of organs that work together to perform one or more functions. Example: Integumentary, Nervous, Digestive, etc. Organism \u00b6 A living thing made up of one or more cells that is able to carry on the activities of life. Body functions necessary for life \u00b6 The eight (8) bodily functions necessary for life are: Maintaining boundaries \u00b6 The internal environment must be separate or distinct from the external environment. This is an important concept when we discuss Homeostasis Metabolism \u00b6 Metabolism is defined as chemical reactions in the body. Catabolism is when complex substances are broken into simpler parts and energy is released. Anabolism is when simple parts use energy to construct complex substances. Responsiveness \u00b6 Also known as excitability . Responding and reacting to changes in the internal and external environment. The Nervous System is mostly involved in responsiveness. Movement \u00b6 Occurs in body through muscles due to Contractility . Many types/examples throughout the body: Blood Cells Breathing muscles Skeletal muscles Food Reproduction \u00b6 There are two types: Formation of new person (organism) Formation of new cells (cellular) Both types are essential for life and the continuation of a species. Growth \u00b6 Increase in the size of a body part or entire organism. Anabolic (constructive) processes must occur faster than Catabolic (destructive) processes. Digestion \u00b6 The metabolic process of breaking down food into simpler molecules to be used by the body Excretion \u00b6 The removal of waste products and toxic substances from the body that theaten life. Also the removal of byproducts, substances that the body is unable to utilize for useful purposes. Eleven body systems and their functions \u00b6 The following are organ systems , a collection of organs that work together to make the body work. Integumentary System \u00b6 Covers and protects the body; also regulates temperature. Skeletal System \u00b6 Provides body framework and support; attaches muscles to bones; provides calcium storage. Muscular System \u00b6 Produces movement, maintains posture and provides heat. Nervous System \u00b6 Coordinates body activities; receives and transmits stimuli. Endocrine System \u00b6 Regulates metabolic activities and body chemistry. Cardiovascular System \u00b6 Transports materials from one part of the body to another; defends against disease. Lymphatic (Immune) System \u00b6 Returns tissue fluid to the blood; defends against disease. Digestive System \u00b6 Ingests and digests food; absorbs nutrients into the blood. Respiratory System \u00b6 Exchanges gases between the blood and the external environment. Urinary System \u00b6 Involved in excretion of metabolic waste; regulates fluid balance and acid-base (pH) balance. Reproductive System \u00b6 Forms new individuals contributing to the continuation of the species. Homeostasis and its function in maintaining life \u00b6 Homeostasis refers to a constant internal environment even though the external world is constantly changing. All organ systems of the body, under direction from the nervous and endocrine system, work together to maintain homeostasis. Homeostatic Control \u00b6 Homeostasis is also referred to as the set point (desired value of a variable). There are three (3) main components of homeostasis: Receptor \u00b6 Receives information from a stimulus regarding the status of the body and relays it to the control center along the afferent pathway. Control Center \u00b6 Processes information received from the receptor and sends signals to the effector along the efferent pathway. Effector \u00b6 A cell, tissue, or organ that receives information from the control center and sends a signal to the appropriate place to stimulate action and return the body to equilibrium. Feedback Loop Mechanisms \u00b6 Negative Feedback Positive Feedback Example Regulation of body temperature or blood glucose Normal childbirth Response Reverses a change in physiological condition Intensifies a change in physiological condition Result Return to a set point Reach an end point Overall Provide stability Accelerates a process to completion Negative Feedback \u00b6 A product of a reaction leads to a decrease in the frequency of that reaction. A good example of this is the regulation of body temperature because, of course, body temperature doesn't just swing above its target value\u2014it can also drop below this value. In general, homeostatic circuits usually involve at least two negative feedback loops: One is activated when a parameter\u2014like body temperature\u2014is _above_ the set point and is designed to bring it back down. One is activated when the parameter is _below_ the set point and is designed to bring it back up. Positive Feedback \u00b6 A product of a reaction leads to an increase of in the frequency of that reaction. A positive feedback loop comes into play during childbirth. In childbirth, the baby's head presses on the cervix\u2014the bottom of the uterus, through which the baby must emerge\u2014and activates neurons to the brain. The neurons send a signal that leads to release of the hormone oxytocin from the pituitary gland. Oxytocin increases uterine contractions, and thus pressure on the cervix. This causes the release of even more oxytocin and produces even stronger contractions. This positive feedback loop continues until the baby is born. Further Understanding \u00b6 Directional terms of the body \u00b6 The directional terms used to describe the body are: Superior \u00b6 Means above or in a higher position (closer to the head). Example: The eyes are superior to the neck. Inferior \u00b6 Means below or in a lower position (closer to the feet). Example: The chest is inferior to the neck. Ventral/Anterior \u00b6 Means located towards the front of the body; toward the belly surface. Example: The abdomen is ventral to the back. Dorsal/Posterior \u00b6 Means located towards the back of the body. Example: The spine is dorsal to the breastbone. Medial \u00b6 Means nearer to the middle of the body. Example: The nose is medial to the ears. Lateral \u00b6 Means nearer to the side of the body. Example: The ears are lateral to the eyes. Proximal \u00b6 Means nearer to the point of origin of the structure. Example: The elbow is proximal to the wrist. Distal \u00b6 Means farther from the point of origin of the structure. Example: The fingers are distal to the wrist. Superficial \u00b6 Means near or on surface of the body. Example: The superficial (outermost layer) of the skin is the epidermis. Deep \u00b6 Means farther away from the surface of the body. Example: Muscles are deep to the skin. Cranial \u00b6 Refers to the head end of the body. Example: Cranial pressure causes headaches. Caudal \u00b6 Refers to the tail end of the body. Example: Caudal anesthetic is injected into the lower spine. Visceral \u00b6 Pertains to the internal organs or the coverings of organs. Example: The visceral pericardium, which is a membrane, covers the heart. Parietal \u00b6 Pertains to the wall of a body cavity. Example: The abdominal cavity is lined with parietal peritoneum. Further Understanding \u00b6 Three planes of division of the body \u00b6 Sagittal Plane \u00b6 The body is split into left and right sections Transverse Plane \u00b6 The body is split into superior (upper) and inferior (lower) sections. Frontal Plane \u00b6 The body is split into anterior/ventral (front) and posterior/dorsal sections. Two major body cavities and their subdivisions \u00b6 The body is divided into two main cavities: the ventral/anterior and dorsal/posterior cavity . Ventral/Anterior Cavity \u00b6 The ventral/anterior cavity is in the anterior (front) of the body. It consists of two components: the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity . The abdominopelvic cavity is made up of the abdominal cavity and the pelvic cavity. The thoracic cavity contains the main organs of the respiratory and cardiovascular system ( lungs, heart ) as well as parts of other systems such as the esophagus, and the thymus gland. The abdominopelvic cavity contains the main organs of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems, as well as parts of the endocrine system ( adrenal glands ) Dorsal/Posterior Cavity \u00b6 The dorsal/posterior cavity is in the posterior (back) of the body. It consists of two components as well: the spinal cavity and the cranial cavity . The spinal cavity (also known as the vertebral cavity) contains the spinal cord, meninges (protective layer) and cerebrospinal fluid (CBF). The cranial cavity contains the space within the skull. It contains the brain, meninges (protective layer) and CBF. Nine abdominal regions and the four abdominal quadrants \u00b6 The abdominal area is usually divided in two ways: nine sections or four abdominal quadrants. The nine abdominal regions \u00b6 The epigastric region is located just above the main organs of the digestive system (stomach, digestive tract, colon, etc.) \"Epi\" is a prefix meaning \"above or upon\" and \"gastric\" means \"of the stomach\". The hypochondriac regions are located on either side of the epigastric region and just below the pectorals. \"Hypo\" means \"under or below\" and chondriac refers to the cartilage of the ribs. The umbilical region is amptly named, referring to the navel area and the location of the umbilical cord. The lumbar regions are located on either side of the umbilical region and directly below the hypochondriac regions respectively. The hypogastic region is located directly below the umbilical region and the main organs of the digestive system. The iliac regions are located on either side of the hypogastric region and contain the iliac bone (a main part of the hip bone). The four abdominal quadrants \u00b6","title":"Levels of Organization & Major Divisions"},{"location":"Courses/Semester%201/PN1109%20-%20Anatomy%20and%20Physiology%20I/Objective%201/Levels%20of%20Organization%20and%20Major%20Divisions/#levels-of-organization-major-divisions","text":"","title":"Levels of Organization &amp; Major Divisions"},{"location":"Courses/Semester%201/PN1109%20-%20Anatomy%20and%20Physiology%20I/Objective%201/Levels%20of%20Organization%20and%20Major%20Divisions/#levels-of-organization-in-the-body","text":"","title":"Levels of organization in the body"},{"location":"Courses/Semester%201/PN1109%20-%20Anatomy%20and%20Physiology%20I/Objective%201/Levels%20of%20Organization%20and%20Major%20Divisions/#chemical","text":"Refers to atoms, molecules, macromolecules, and organelles.","title":"Chemical"},{"location":"Courses/Semester%201/PN1109%20-%20Anatomy%20and%20Physiology%20I/Objective%201/Levels%20of%20Organization%20and%20Major%20Divisions/#atoms","text":"The basic unit of a chemical element.","title":"Atoms"},{"location":"Courses/Semester%201/PN1109%20-%20Anatomy%20and%20Physiology%20I/Objective%201/Levels%20of%20Organization%20and%20Major%20Divisions/#molecule","text":"A group of atoms bonded together.","title":"Molecule"},{"location":"Courses/Semester%201/PN1109%20-%20Anatomy%20and%20Physiology%20I/Objective%201/Levels%20of%20Organization%20and%20Major%20Divisions/#macromolecule","text":"A molecule containing a very large number of atoms.

It contains approximately 206 bones. It forms the framework of the body, which is rigid and strong but lightweight. Bones have surface markings as well as unique characteristics such as holes, depressions, projections and lines. Consists of active tissue that is involved in the body's function. Three types of skeletal cartilage \u00b6 Hyaline \u00b6 A bluish-white translucent type of cartilage mostly present in the joints and respiratory tract. Provide support, flexibility, and resistance They are the most abundant type of cartilage found throughout the body Made of thick, collagen fibers Types of Hyaline Cartilage \u00b6 Articular \u00b6 Covers the end of most bones at movable joints. Costal \u00b6 Responsible for connecting the ribs to the sternum. Respiratory \u00b6 Forms the skeleton of the larynx and reinforces the passageways of the respiratory system. Nasal \u00b6 Supports the external nose. Elastic \u00b6 Quite similar to hyaline cartilage but is made of elastic fibers and can bend more easily. It is found in the epiglottis and the external ear. Fibrocartilage \u00b6 A type of cartilage that has great tensile strength and is highly compressible. It is found in areas that will be subjected to pressure and can stretch. Found mostly in the vertebral discs and the knee (caps). Growth of cartilage \u00b6 Appositional growth \u00b6 The increase in diameter of the bone by the addition of bony tissue at the surface. This increases bone thickness . This happens during late adolescence and throughout adulthood. Interstitial growth \u00b6 The increase in length of the growing bone. This works by chondrocutes dividing and secreting a new matrix, expanding the cartilage from within. This happens during childhood and early adolescence. Classification of Bones \u00b6 Bones are classified based on region, shape, and embryonic development. Region \u00b6 Divided into two (2) groups based on location. Axial Skeleton \u00b6 The skull, vertebral column, and rib cage. This region is comprised of 74 bones including 6 ear bones. Appendicular Skeleton \u00b6 The upper and lower limbs. This region is comprised of 126 bones. Shape \u00b6 There are four (4) distinct shapes of bones: long bones, short bones, flat bones, and irregular bones. Long Bones \u00b6 Has a long shaft with two bulky ends. The long shaft is called a diaphysis and the bulky ends are epiphysis . The name is derived from their elongated shape and not the actual size of the bone. Three (3) bones in the finger are also classified as long bones even though they are small. Found in the thigh, leg, arms and forearm. Short Bones \u00b6 Cube-shaped bones that vary in size and number in different individuals. Found in the wrist and ankle. Sesamoid bones are a special type of short bone that forms in a tendon (patella). Flat Bones \u00b6 These bones are thin, flat and often curved. Found in the skull, sternum, scapula and ribs. Irregular Bones \u00b6 These bones are any bones that do not fall into the other categories. They often have complicated, peculiar shapes. Examples include the vertebrae, hip bones, some skull bones, and facial bones. Embryonic Development \u00b6 There are two categories: intramembraneous and endochondral ossification. Intramembraneous Ossification \u00b6 The process of bone development from fibrous membranes. It replaces the connective tissue membranes with bony tissue and occurs during fetal development. Examples include the flat bones of the skull, mandible","title":"Skeletal System"},{"location":"Courses/Semester%201/PN1109%20-%20Anatomy%20and%20Physiology%20I/Objective%205/Skeletal%20System/#skeletal-system","text":"","title":"Skeletal System"},{"location":"Courses/Semester%201/PN1109%20-%20Anatomy%20and%20Physiology%20I/Objective%205/Skeletal%20System/#quick-facts","text":"The skeletal system is made up of bones , cartilage , ligaments and tendons .

Evolution of Gerontological Nursing \u00b6 In the early 1900's, caring for seniors was custodial in nature and focused moreso on physical aspects and not multiple dimensions of the individual. Taking care and treating physical conditions was the number one priority. Those who could afford to do so, however, would care for older adults at home and hire nurses to service them. Vera McIver and the Priory Method \u00b6 Vera McIver, a nurse, believed that the state of nursing care at the time was encouraging dependence, restricted movement, and contributed to the death of the human spirit. By focusing on physical ailments and what the patient couldn't do, the patient would sooner experience a lack of dignity and wholeness. In response, she invented a restorative model of care known as the Priory Method . The Priory Method \u00b6 This model of care focuses on providing the patient with independence and includes them as an active participant in their care. For example, a person who has limited movement due to a stroke is usually provided with 'complete' care because half of their body is paralyzed and in recovery. However, the nurse can involve the patient by encouraging the person to feed themselves with their working hand, wash their own face, etc. This helps maintain a patient's independence and helps them to feel better because they are able to care for themselves and do things in some capacity. Canadian Association of Gerontology \u00b6 Founded on October 15, 1971 as a registered Canadian charity, the Canadian Association of Gerontology (CAG) is a national, multidisciplinary scientific and educational establishment. They established six (6) competencies and standards of practice. Six Competencies \u00b6 Physiological health Optimizing functional health Responsive care Relationship care Health system Safety and security Development of Gerontological Nursing \u00b6 Nursing Roles \u00b6 Where is gerontological care needed? It is required in a variety of settings, of which include: - Hospitals - Homes - Acute and long-term care facilities - Communities - Rehabilitation care centers The mission and primary role of nurses in gerontological care is to preserve function, enhance health, quality of life and end of life care. Caring: Holistic Focus \u00b6 There are several dimensions in relation to caring for older adults and promoting optimal health. Holistic approaches are preferred and work by addressing the biopsychosocial and spiritual needs of the older adult. Biopsychosocial and spiritual needs \u00b6 This caring focus is an integral part of the conceptual framework and philosophy of the practical nursing program. Bio refers to the dimension of physical health. This part relates to how well an older adult is able to function physically in the face of illness or delibitating disease. This varies from person to person. Psycho refers to psychological health. How well can the older adult cope with stress and mentally taxing stimuli? The loss of mental faculties and coping capabilities is experienced at different levels and in many different ways. Social refers to social health. Human beings are social animals, and the state of our social lives and how we interact with those around us is immensely important to both physical and mental health. Spiritual refers to spiritual health. Although many people think of religion when exploring the spiritual dimension of a human being, it is important to note that this part of us goes much deeper and can be represented and appear in several different ways. Setting \u00b6 Care is provided to older adults in many different locations. Most commonly, care is provided in institutions such as long-term care, acute care, and community care settings. The care is directly provided by RNs, LPNs, PCAs and also overseen/monitored by physicians, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists. Long-term care (LTC) \u00b6 This setting is not easy to define because the boundaries between primary, acute and long-term care have blurred. The main goal of long-term care facilities is to concentrate on assisting individuals with functioning as well as they possibly can. They are often known as \"nursing homes\" and most residents are older adults with complex needs. The services are designed to minimize, rehabilitate, or compensate for loss of independent physical or mental functioning. Services provided include: - Bathing - Dressing - Feeding - Other personal care - Meal preparation - Cleaning - Shopping - Money management - Medication management - Transportation Over 50% (half) of residents are 85 years or older and 2/3 have cognitive impairment. Here you will find the frailest of the older adult population that requires 24-hour care. Most residents have chronic illnesses and require very high levels of care. Roles of LPNs \u00b6 The roles of LPNs working in long-term care include: Leadership - The LPN is often responsible for a number of residents, constructing and implementing a plan that will lead to optimal health. Decision-making - The LPN must be able to think on their feet and manage difficult situations. Will have to know the appropriate response in certain situations and when to call the RN who is overseeing multiple units. Knowledgeable - The LPN is always learning and must be up to date with the best practice guidelines in order to provide optimal care and provide guidance and support PCAs. Effective communication and collaboration - The LPN should know and be familiar with the RN as the first line to discuss care needs of residents. Delegation of tasks to PCAs - The LPNs oversee the work of PCAs, who provide basic are to residents. Roles of RNs \u00b6 The responsibilities of RNs are rooted in higher level decision-making. This involves overseeing LPNs, implementing and collaborating with the interdisciplinary team and family regarding a plan for the level of care for each resident. These include: - Comfort care measures - Palliative care - Ethical and legal implications of actions - Mental capacity - Enduring power of attorney - Managing skill mix and assigning staff and tasks appropriately according to individual needs Rights of clients in LTC \u00b6 The rights of clients should be at the forefront and reflected in the mission, vision, and values of the health care provider and setting. Everybody involved in the caring process should be aware of institutional policies regarding these rights. Acute care \u00b6 This setting is active but supposed to be temporary where older adults are cared for up until they are able to be discharged and return to normal life. Older adults comprise a large number of patients in acute care settings. The role of nurses in this setting is to become knowledgeable about the needs of older adults and being able to understand and handle the complexity of managing multiple conditions and needs. The prevention of further complications is usually the primary focus for nurses providing acute care. Community-based \u00b6 Approximately 93% of older adults live in community settings. These include home care, independent living complexes, retirement communities, and adult day care programs. Seniors have the desire to age and live in their own homes. Health promotion is important here to promote optimal function and safety for the individual and family. This is especially important for older adults with chronic illnesses who want to maintain their independence and live in familiar surroundings. The future of gerontological care \u00b6 As of right now, demand is critical for gerontological nurses and other health professionals to care for older people. People are getting increasingly older and more staff is needed to meet this demand. The shortage of nurses is an issue that will hopefully be resolved as time moves on. The Baby Boomers are a significant portion of the population that is getting older. Well versed regarding their health challenges, treatments and ways of staying healthy. It will be helpful to be familiar with the mindset of this group of older adults. Also, global policites must be developed to meet income, health, and long-term care needs for men and women throughout the world. Communicating with older persons \u00b6 There are several factors that influence communication with older adults: Ageism Culture Sensory deficits Level of wellness Mental health issues Elderspeak \u00b6 This is a form of ageism where young people alter their speech based on the assuption that older adults will have difficulty understanding and comprehending them. This is similar to how we speak to children or house pets. Components of effective communication \u00b6 The best way to communicate effectively is to: Avoid using Elderspeak Be present and respectful Listen intently Ensure a non-judgmental attitude Learn about and consider cultural differences and barriers Use open-ended questions often and use close-ended questions when seeking information Validate the older person and attempt to understand It's so important to listen and encourage older adults to share their story and who they are. Not only is it crucial in personal growth, but in the development of nurse-client relationships. Nurses are privileged to be able to be around to hear about the personal life and many experiences of an older person. Culture, ethnicity and aging \u00b6 Canada is a multicultural society. In fact, approximately 1/3 of Canadians over the age of 65 are immigrants. Not only that, but 6 million are visible minorities and 1.4 million are members of the indigenous community.
